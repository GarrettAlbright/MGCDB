Must-haves before being "done":
- [x] Update README - tasks, NGINX config
- [x] Update code to match saner defaults in README
- [x] Clean up/refactor templating (back end parts)
- [x] Catalina status - screen scraping
- [x] User accounts
- [x] Votes
- [x] Searchable game list
- [ ] Tests, probably
- [ ] Link to game's Steam store page

Nice to haves:
- [ ] Allow specifying custom port for daemon in config
- [ ] Allow specifying custom config file location from CLI
- [ ] Adult game filter (remove all the damned "hentai poker" games and so on)

Must-haves before being "done":
- [ ] Tests, probably

Nice to haves:
- [ ] Allow specifying custom port for daemon in config
- [ ] Allow specifying custom config file location from CLI
- [ ] Adult game filter (remove all the damned "hentai poker" games and so on)
- [ ] Categories/tags in general
- [ ] Windows instructions in README.md (if even necessary)
